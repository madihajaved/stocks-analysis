# stocks-analysis
## Overview of the project 
This project aimed to calculate the total volume traded in a stock for any year the user chose and its annual return. The project included data for years 2017 and 2018 and had data on the same 12 stocks for both the years. To achieve the object, we used VBA to automate some steps and ensure the code was refactored to minimize the processing time. 

## Results 
Based on the refactored code, the analysis took less time, closer to 0.15 seconds compared to over a second it was taking before. 
When running the code for year 2017, the following image shows the time it took to run the refactored code:

For 2018, it takes a similar time as the image shows:

## Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code 
Some advantages of refactoring which emerged were:
### Less is more
The code itself is tighter helping to achieve the same in lesser space.

### Processing time 
Processing time improved significantly.

Some general disadvantages are: 
### Requires more expertise
It requires more expertise so might be harder to work across various users. Comments to explain the steps obviously help. 

### Can take longer to code 
Despite the shorter length, it took me longer to refactor the code.

## Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in VBA 
In addition to the ones mentioned above, I would say that VBA debugging was harder than expected. Given that refactored code is more complex, it was harder to correct and ensure it was running smoothly. 
However, an added advantage of using arrays in the refactored code really helped avoid repeating a lot of code which became redundant.
